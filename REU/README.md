# to-do

- move outlier files into folders
- possibly link src to github page? (as done in https://github.com/sigmorphon2020/task0-baselines)
- finish writing out README's for each folder
- compile dependencies list (shouldnt be more than whats needed for src + pandas)
- write up short summary and results in README
