# File Structure

- `customshells/`
  + this includes all the shell scripts used to run the training and testing data though the neural-transducer models.
 
- `datacollection/`
  + this includes python scripts used to scrape data, or create new data, from the models output file structures and the languages file structures.
  
- `scraped_data/`
  + this includes the scraped data files that are used in the analysis and final report of the [PROJECT]
  
- `src/`
  + this is the source files that hole the neural-transducer. These files are the original source files taken from Sig Task0
  
- `task0-data/`
  + this includes all the language data from Sig Task0, as well as the custom language files created and used in the [PROJECT]


- `lemma_&_random/`
	+ this contains the files created and used to run the random and lemma implementations. These files were used in the main `neural-transducer_modifications/` folder

- `full_data_augmentation`
	+ this contains the files created and used to run the full data augmentation implementations. These files were used in the main `neural-transducer_modifications/` folder

# to-do

- move outlier files into folders
- possibly link src to github page? (as done in https://github.com/sigmorphon2020/task0-baselines)
- finish writing out README's for each folder
- compile dependencies list (shouldnt be more than whats needed for src + pandas)
- write up short summary and results in README
